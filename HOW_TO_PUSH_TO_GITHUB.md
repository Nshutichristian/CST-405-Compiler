## Option 1: Push Using GitHub Desktop (EASIEST) âœ…

### Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop application
2. Select your repository: `CST-405`

### Step 2: Push
1. Click the "Push origin" button at the top
2. That's it! Your changes will be uploaded.

---

## Option 2: Push Using Git Bash/Terminal with Personal Access Token

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (if you don't have one)

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click your profile picture â†’ Settings
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (left sidebar)
4. Click "Personal access tokens" â†’ "Tokens (classic)"
5. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
6. Give it a name: "CST-405 Compiler"
7. Select scopes: Check `repo` (full control)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **COPY THE TOKEN** - you won't see it again!

### Step 2: Push with Token

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/mnt/c/Users/nshut/Documents/CST 405/projects/aime Moria/CST-405"

# Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for credentials)
git push origin main

# When prompted:
# Username: aimemoria
# Password: [PASTE YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN]
```

## Option 3: Configure Git Credential Helper (For Future Pushes)

### Setup Once:

```bash
# Configure credential helper
git config --global credential.helper store

# Set your git identity
git config --global user.name "Christian Nshuti Manzi"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Now push (you'll enter credentials once)
git push origin main

# Future pushes won't ask for credentials!
```

## Option 4: Manual Push Using VSCode

### If you have VSCode installed:

1. Open the project folder in VSCode
2. Click the Source Control icon (left sidebar)
3. You'll see your commit ready to push
4. Click the "..." menu â†’ "Push"
5. Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Check what's ready to push
git status

# View the commit
git log -1

# Push to GitHub (choose your method above)
git push origin main

# If push fails, check remote
git remote -v

# Force push (only if necessary and you're sure)
git push -f origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- **Solution**: Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- GitHub no longer accepts passwords for git operations
- Follow Option 2 above to create a token

### "fatal: could not read Username"
- **Solution**: Use GitHub Desktop (Option 1) or configure credentials (Option 3)

### "Updates were rejected"
- **Solution**: Pull first, then push
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### "Permission denied"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify: https://github.com/aimemoria/CST-405

## After Successful Push

### Verify on GitHub:

1. Visit: https://github.com/aimemoria/CST-405
2. Check the commit history
3. Verify all files are there
4. Check that README displays properly

### Share Your Repository:

Your repository URL:
```
https://github.com/aimemoria/CST-405
```

Anyone can now:
- View your code
- Read your documentation
- See your commit history with both authors credited

## Summary

**Status**: âœ… Changes are committed locally

**Next Step**: Choose ONE of these methods:
1. **GitHub Desktop** (Easiest - just click "Push origin")
2. **Terminal with Token** (git push + personal access token)
3. **VSCode** (Use source control panel)
4. **Configure credentials** (One-time setup for future)

**After pushing, your complete compiler with full author attribution will be live on GitHub!**

## Need Help?

If you're still having trouble:

1. Try GitHub Desktop (simplest method)
2. Create a Personal Access Token
