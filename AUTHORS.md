- Line and column tracking for error reporting

### 2. Syntax Analysis
- Context-free grammar parsing with Bison
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction
- **NEW:** While loop and condition grammar rules
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 3. Semantic Analysis
- Symbol table with hash table implementation
- Type checking and validation
- Variable declaration and initialization checking
- **NEW:** Condition type checking for loops

### 4. Intermediate Code Generation
- Three-Address Code (TAC) generation
- Temporary variable and label generation
- **NEW:** Label-based control flow for loops
- **NEW:** Conditional jump instructions

### 5. Code Generation
- x86-64 assembly code generation (NASM syntax)
- System V AMD64 ABI compliance
- Printf integration for output
- **NEW:** Comparison and jump instructions
- **NEW:** All relational operators (6 variants)

## Significant Feature: While Loops with Relational Operators

### Feature Overview
The addition of **while loops** with **relational operators** is a significant language extension that:

1. **Adds Control Flow**: Introduces iteration beyond sequential execution
2. **Touches All Phases**: Requires modifications in every compiler phase
3. **Non-Trivial Complexity**: Adds 345+ lines of implementation code
4. **Language Completeness**: Makes the language Turing-complete

### Implementation Details

#### Tokens Added (Lexer)
- `while` keyword
- Relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- Block delimiters: `{`, `}`
- Comment support: `//`

#### Grammar Rules (Parser)
```
while_stmt → WHILE LPAREN condition RPAREN LBRACE statement_list RBRACE
condition  → expression RELOP expression
```

#### AST Nodes
- `NODE_WHILE`: While loop node with condition and body
- `NODE_CONDITION`: Relational comparison node

#### TAC Instructions
- `TAC_LABEL`: Loop start and end labels
- `TAC_GOTO`: Unconditional jump (loop back)
- `TAC_IF_FALSE`: Conditional jump (loop exit)
- `TAC_RELOP`: Relational operation

#### Assembly Instructions
- `cmp`: Compare operands
- `setl`, `setg`, `setle`, `setge`, `sete`, `setne`: Set based on comparison
- `je`: Jump if equal (false condition)
- `jmp`: Unconditional jump (loop back)
